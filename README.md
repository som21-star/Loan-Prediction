# Loan-Prediction
A Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customersâ€™ segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. I used R, Python and PyCaret. I have provided the datasets as well. After doing data pre-processing, model building and model evaluation part I achieved an accuracy of 84% using XGBoost.
